# Docker UNMS

This is an all-in-one Docker image for running the [Ubiquiti Network Management System](https://unms.com/). This image contains all the components required to run [UNMS](https://unms.com/) in a single container and uses the [s6-overlay](https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay) for process management.

This image will run on most platforms that support Docker including [Docker for Mac](https://www.docker.com/docker-mac), [Docker for Windows](https://www.docker.com/docker-windows), Synology DSM and Raspberry Pi boards.

## Usage

```shell
docker run \
  -p 80:80 \
  -p 443:443 \
  -p 2055:2055/udp \
  -e TZ=<timezone> \
  -v </path/to/config>:/config \
  nico640/docker-unms:latest
```

## Raspberry Pi / ARM

This image will also allow you to run [UNMS](https://unms.com/) on a Raspberry Pi or other Docker-enabled ARMv7/8 devices.

```
docker run -d --name unms -p 80:80 -p 443:443 -p 2055:2055/udp -v </path/to/config>:/config nico640/docker-unms:latest
```

## Parameters
